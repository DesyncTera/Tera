A simple PowerSwitcher that switches the currect power mode from Balanced to Power Saver. Of course this can go back and fourth, this is just for people who don't really do anything such as gaming/modeling and have a high/mid end PC, it just saves time from going all the way into control panel and searching for the power mode each time.
