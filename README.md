A simple PowerSwitcher that switches the currect power mode from Balanced to Power Saver. Of course this can go back and fourth, this is just for people who don't really do anything such as gaming/modeling and have a high/mid end PC, it just saves time from going all the way into control panel and searching for the power mode each time. 

Note: This does not modify the individual settings of each power mode; it only switches between them. To adjust the settings for each mode and manage your PC's resource usage, you can customize them through the Control Panel. Control panel > HardWare And Sounds > Power Options > Change Plan Settings > Customize each to your liking. I personaly put the power saver on the lowest possible due to high electrical bills (this is mostly on when I'm watching a movie/YouTube). 



Another note: I did not add an Icon as I am a beginner so I have no idea, you can add one on your own if you'd like to.
